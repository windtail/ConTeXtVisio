Copy the dll's to one of the package.cpath, if you do not know luatex's cpath,
just compile luapath.tex

luacom.dll: a modified luacom, see https://github.com/windtail/luacom
iconv.dll: lua-iconv module, see http://ittner.github.com/lua-iconv/
           this dll is compiled on mingw, so it depends on libiconv-2.dll
libiconv-2.dll: iconv.dll depends on it
