* Introduction

Help including visio graph into ConTeXt MKIV document.

** where to search the visio file  ?
1. "."
2. "./image"
3. "./figure"
4. "./visio"
5.  search in global search directory list (see \setupvisiodirectory below)

** where are the converted PDF files ?
All PDF files are in  PDF output directory (see \setupvisiodirectory ),
the output directory will be created automatically at first PDF outputting.

The PDF filename is determine by  MD5 value of user supplied visio file name, with a prefix('p')

** why use such strange PDF names ?
Currently MKIV do not support including filenames with Chinese characters(this is the Microsoft problem) , 
i have to convert it English name and keep the each filename unique, md5 is a simple and suitable
algorithm.

** what the source and system encoding ?
source encoding is the tex source file's encoding, usually UTF-8,
system encoding is the Windows system encoding, for me its gb2312, all file names are encoded with
gb2312. you can change it using \setupvisioencoding  command

** what you did to my visio files ?
i export it to PDF file with specified margin, i have to change some print settings,
but i did not save that changes, so i did nothing to your visio files.

The operations to VISIO file is modified according to a manually recored VBA macro, DON'T ask me why,
i do not fully understand visio VBAs

* Install

** Copy the visio directory to <texmf-local>\context\third\
** in ConTeXt prompt, run luatools --generate
** see README in clibs directory

* Command

\setupvisiodirectory[1][2]
  #1 pdf,visio
  #2 
     #1=pdf 
        PDF output directory, absolute or related path (default to current directory)
      
     #1=visio 
      	global VISIO search directory comma list (default empty list)
  
\usevisio[1][2]
  #1 visio filename without .vsd extension (absolute or related path)
  #2 optional margins (uint: mm)
     left  = NUMBER (default 0)
     right = NUMBER
     top   = NUMBER
     bottom= NUMBER

\visio[1][2] 
  #1 visio filename without .vsd, MUST be the same with that used in \usevisio 
  #2 (optional) the same as the last parameter of \externalfigure (because i just leave it untouched to \externalfigure ^_^)

\setupvisioencoding[1]
  #1 source = tex source file encoding(default UTF-8)
     system = system(Windows) encoding (default GBK)

* Test environment

** Windows XP SP3 simplified Chinese edition
** ConTeXt : 2012.03.13 
** LuaTeX : beta-0.70.1-2012031317
** Visio 2010 (14.0.6.106.5005 32bit simplified Chinese edition)

* Known issues

** sometimes luatex will hang for the first time 
** dimesion of visio is not output to ConTeXt, that need more work
